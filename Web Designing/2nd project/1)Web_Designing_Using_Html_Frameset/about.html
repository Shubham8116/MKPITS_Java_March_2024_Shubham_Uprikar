       <u> Experience Maruti Suzuki World</u>
    

<p><font size="5" color="maroon"><em>Cars are what Maruti Suzuki builds. Experiences are what it creates.</em></p>
    <p><font size="4" color="maroon"> Experiences fuelled by innovations, forward thinking, and a commitment to bring the very best to Indian roads. From the day the iconic Maruti 800 was launched in 1983, the company has been spearheading a revolution of change. Turning an entire countryâ€™s need for driving, into its love for driving.
        However, tastes and demands keep on evolving with each new generation of Indians. This has not been looked at by Maruti Suzuki as a challenge, but as an inspiration to go beyond traditional boundaries of car-making. Infusing design and technology is one such step it has taken to make its cars meet new age expectations smoothly.
        Today, Maruti Suzuki has its eyes set firmly on the possibilities of tomorrow. And everybody is invited on this journey.</p>
